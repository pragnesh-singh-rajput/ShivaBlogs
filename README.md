## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   npm or yarn (or pnpm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub repo details)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    This project uses Resend.com for newsletter subscriptions. You'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Resend API Key and Audience ID.
    ```env
    # .env.local
    RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY
    RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=YOUR_RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID

    **Note**: `.env.local` is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to your repository.
