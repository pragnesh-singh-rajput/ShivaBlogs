      <p class="mb-4">Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs directly in your markup, without writing much, if any, custom CSS.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-primary">Core Concepts</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Understand how utilities like <code class="bg-muted px-1 rounded text-foreground/90">flex</code>, <code class="bg-muted px-1 rounded text-foreground/90">pt-4</code> (padding-top), and <code class="bg-muted px-1 rounded text-foreground/90">text-center</code> combine to create complex components. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, now standard, ensures your final CSS bundle includes only the styles you actually use, keeping it remarkably small.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-primary">Configuration and Customization</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Tailwind is highly customizable via its <code class="bg-muted px-1 rounded text-foreground/90">tailwind.config.js</code> file. You can extend or override the default design system, including colors, spacing, fonts, breakpoints, and much more. This allows you to tailor Tailwind to perfectly match your project's specific aesthetic requirements.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This approach encourages rapid prototyping and development while maintaining visual consistency and a structured design language.</p>
