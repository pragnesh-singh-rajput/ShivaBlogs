## Modern Attack Vectors

The threat landscape has evolved significantly, with attackers leveraging new technologies and methodologies:

### 1. Cloud-Native Attacks
Modern applications increasingly rely on cloud infrastructure, creating new attack surfaces:
- **Container Escape Techniques**: Exploiting misconfigurations in Docker and Kubernetes
- **Serverless Function Abuse**: Targeting AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions
- **API Gateway Bypasses**: Circumventing authentication and authorization controls

### 2. AI-Powered Reconnaissance
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how penetration testers gather intelligence:
- **Automated OSINT Collection**: Using ML to correlate data from multiple sources
- **Social Engineering Enhancement**: AI-generated deepfakes and personalized phishing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying subtle vulnerabilities in large codebases

## Advanced Exploitation Techniques

Understanding the digital landscape is crucial for modern security professionals.

### Memory Corruption in Modern Languages
Even memory-safe languages can have vulnerabilities:

```rust
// Example: Use-after-free in Rust using unsafe blocks
unsafe {
    let mut data = Box::new(42);
    let ptr = &mut *data as *mut i32;
    drop(data);
    *ptr = 1337; // Use-after-free vulnerability
}
```

### Supply Chain Attacks
Targeting the software supply chain has become increasingly common:
- **Dependency Confusion**: Exploiting package managers
- **Build Pipeline Compromise**: Injecting malicious code during CI/CD
- **Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities**: Identifying zero-days in popular libraries

The integration of AI in cybersecurity continues to evolve rapidly.

## Conclusion

The field of penetration testing continues to evolve rapidly. Security professionals must stay current with emerging threats, new technologies, and advanced techniques.

*Remember: These techniques should only be used in authorized penetration testing engagements with proper written permission.*
